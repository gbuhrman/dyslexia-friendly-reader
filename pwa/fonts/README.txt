Drop OpenDyslexic webfonts here as WOFF2 files, for example:

- OpenDyslexic3-Regular.woff2
- OpenDyslexic3-Bold.woff2
- OpenDyslexic3-Italic.woff2
- OpenDyslexic3-BoldItalic.woff2

Then, in reader.css, you can enable the @font-face blocks (already added below)
or keep the fallback stack if you prefer system fonts.
